Project Overview
This project focuses on using Python and the Pandas library to analyze and manipulate a dataset of baby names. The dataset provides insights into the popularity of baby names over time, allowing us to perform operations such as data exploration, manipulation, and analysis. The project demonstrates the power of Pandas for handling, cleaning, and extracting meaningful information from structured data.

1.Data Loading: Read and load the baby name dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Understand the structure of the dataset using head(), info(), and describe().
Identify missing values and handle them effectively.
2.Data Manipulation:
Filter data based on specific criteria (e.g., year, gender, or name popularity).
Perform group-by operations to aggregate data and compute summary statistics.
Add, modify, or remove columns to enhance dataset usability.
3.Data Analysis:
Find the most popular baby names for each year or gender.
Visualize trends over time for specific names or groups of names.
Analyze name distributions and patterns.

# Dataset
The baby name dataset contains the following columns:

Name: The name of the baby.
Year: The year of birth.
Gender: The gender of the baby (M for male, F for female).
Count: The number of babies given the name in that year.

# Technologies Used
